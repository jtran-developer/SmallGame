This is a pretty standard maze game.  Initially, you start at the top right corner and find your way to the goal which is represented by the gold star.  You control the block with the arrow keys: up, down, left right.  You can double your speed by pressing the PageUp key.  Pressing PageDown will return your speed to its initial setting.  Once you reach the goal, you will be given the option to restart the game at a new, random start location.
